- The audio bandwidth is also affected by the codec, if it chooses to discard any frequency bands while encoding the sound.
- By chaining all the samples together, you can approximately represent the original wave.
- Each channel contains a sample indicating the amplitude of the audio being produced by that source at a given moment in time. For instance, in stereo sound, there are two audio sources: one speaker on the left, and one on the right. Each of these is represented by one channel.
- The most common sample rates are: 
    8000 Hz     audio used in telephony 
    44100 Hz    used for compact disc (CD) audio
    48000 Hz    DVD, PC
    96000 Hz    High-resolution audio
    192000 Hz   Ultra-high resolution audio
